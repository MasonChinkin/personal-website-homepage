## About

This is a multi-container application using Docker and Docker Compose, with Nginx directing traffic based on subdirectory, essentially allowing me to treat projects like microservices. This is all hosted and continuously deployed with Google Cloud Platform's Compute Engine and Cloud Build, respectively.

The web app itself is using TypeScript and React.
